# pdfcrun.ch

[pdfcrun.ch](https://pdfcrun.ch/) was borne of the recurring patterns I noticed of data being locked up inside PDFs in the wild.

It's currently in private beta testing.

If you're a computer vision expert, please contact me at [this address](mailto:juan+pdfcrunch@uys.io) as my algorithms can always do with betterment.

# MiniLD #69

I decided to enter [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/) (the mini one!) a couple of weeks ago.

My [game](projects/ld69) is called **:isation**, and was made with [three.js](http://threejs.org/).

I [wrote about it](https://opyate.com/2016/07/26/mini-ludum-dare-69/).
