I started hacking on my [mini-LD 69 entry](/projects/ld69/) about 2 weeks ago.

Why? I love games, and wanted to do something other than the Finance Gubbins I'm currently building. *(hush hush - I'll link to it later once I get permission)*

# Notes

I wanted an opportunity to learn [three.js](http://threejs.org/). (It's bloody marvellous!) The aim was to boost my D3.js skill-set with something similar-yet-different, and hopefully now I'm a step closer.

I forgot I also wanted to use [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/), so perhaps I'll brace mini-LD 70 with my [pattern matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Pattern_matching_programming_languages) skills.

Also, I should have definitely spent a bit more time studying Euler angles, Matrix ops, &c up-front instead of tweaking/reloading as often as I did.

I spent a couple of hours a day for the past 2 weeks on it. Being a dad/husband (and on a full-time contract) prevented me from blasting this out in 48/72 hours to feel what a proper LD would be like.

Tests, or lack thereof. But this is a throwaway thingy, so the Test Police can go fiddle one.

# Preview

If the [link to the game](/projects/ld69/) doesn't work, feast your eyes:

If the game does work, see if you can find the Easter Egg.
