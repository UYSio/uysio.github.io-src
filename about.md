# A few things about this website

This website doesn't shove content into a `960px` column, because you can resize your browser window yourself. (and, yes &mdash; your phone and tablet is already a book-like viewport)

This website will also work absolutely fine with JavaScript disabled, because I subscribe to the school of Essentialism.

This website will probably not make your life better in any way, because I have yet to write a thorough, educational long-form piece, and I'd much rather be [hacking](/projects). As such, it's mostly contact details and *"hey, look at this thing I did recently"*.
