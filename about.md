Hi, I'm Juan, and I'm mostly a web developer.

My first encounter with a computer was in 1985. I think it was an [Acorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Computers), and it belonged to my best friend's dad. He once showed us how to dial into his work computer using an [acoustic coupler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_coupler). That &mdash; to me &mdash; was magic.

My encounters then evolved from "configuring" to "programming" circa 1990. This time it was definitely an Acorn. In fact, a whole classroom of it. I learnt [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)), and that &mdash; to me &mdash; was when the magic reached a whole new level.

Hi, I'm Juan, and I'm almost definitely a magician.

# A few things about this website

This website doesn't shove content into a `960px` column, because you can resize your browser window yourself. (and, yes &mdash; your phone and tablet is already a book-like viewport)

This website will also work absolutely fine with JavaScript disabled, because I subscribe to the school of Essentialism.

This website will probably not make your life better in any way, because I have yet to write a thorough, educational long-form piece, and I'd much rather be [hacking](/projects). As such, it's mostly contact details and *"hey, look at this thing I did recently"*.
