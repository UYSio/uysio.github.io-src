I worked on Home Office, Land Registry and Cabinet Office exemplars during [transformation](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/01/29/200-days-of-transformation-200-days-to-go/).

Consulting services included development using Python and Scala, ops with Docker, AWS and Heroku, and guidance around Open Source adoption outside of the GDS.

I was team lead of the API Team, later renamed Platform Team because of the expanded remit, helping them deliver the [style.com](www.style.com) ecommerce service.

Consulting services included development using Clojure, JavaScript, Ruby and PHP, ops with Kubernetes, Docker and AWS, 3rd party integration with Hybris and Mirakl, arhitecture and design aided by regular forums and recruitment via interviews and tests. I also instilled the ["measure measure measure" approach](https://www.gov.uk/performance) adopted at GOV.UK.

I worked on PDF parsing and the lead generation frontend for Credit Monster's credit rating system, helping them reach the number 4 spot for credit rating services in the USA.

Consulting services included development using Scala, PDF technology and AngularJS.

# pdfcrun.ch

[pdfcrun.ch](https://pdfcrun.ch/) was borne out of the recurring patterns of data being locked up inside PDFs in the wild.

It's currently in private beta testing.
