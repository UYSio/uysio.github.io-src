# Government Digital Service

I worked on Home Office, Land Registry and Cabinet Office exemplars during [transformation](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/01/29/200-days-of-transformation-200-days-to-go/).

Consulting services included development using Python and Scala, ops with Docker, AWS and Heroku, and guidance around Open Source adoption outside of the GDS.

I was team lead of the API Team, later renamed Platform Team because of the expanded remit, helping them deliver the [style.com](www.style.com) ecommerce service.

Consulting services included development using Clojure, JavaScript, Ruby and PHP, ops with Kubernetes, Docker and AWS, 3rd party integration with Hybris and Mirakl, arhitecture and design aided by regular forums and recruitment via interviews and tests. I also instilled the ["measure measure measure" approach](https://www.gov.uk/performance) adopted at GOV.UK.

Consulting services included development using Scala, PDF technology and AngularJS.
